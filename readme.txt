I've been thinkin' about ya lately
Reminiscin', going crazy
Miss the way your kiss would keep me up
Hey, wish that you were here tonight
Drinkin' vodka soda, extra limes
And we could just get back to being us

'Cause I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again
Like we were last summer
Want you again, you again, you again
To be stealin' my covers
All tangled in each other, nights still playin' back in my head
I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again, yeah
